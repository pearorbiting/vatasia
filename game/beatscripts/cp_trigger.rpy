# Ersatz Birthday (Trigger) - ersatz bithday celebration at movies leads to being shot by a paintball
```
Esme is shot in the back of the head with a paintball gun. While passed out in medic space, she wanders a blue glow area
(2093 "safe" "alley"). She finds a box. On waking, she hears news incidentally.

- Expert left-field on crash?
- 2093 equiv of marriage prep - what would it be?
